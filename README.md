# Classification-on-Resturant-reviews

Abstract: 
The paper here presents a classification machine learning model to classify
restaurant reviews. The reviews are either positive or negative based on the 
restaurant or the service it provides, the food of the restaurant, staff of the 
restaurant and the environment of the restaurant. A thorough study entailing 
what are the factors that influence the classification of their opinion on the 
restaurant has been taken into consideration with the help of various reviews 
given by the customers. Implementing machine learning algorithms we come 
to a conclusion on which classification algorithm works best with the given set 
of reviews.
The models used for classifying the reviews are:
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Introduction :
In todayâ€™s  world technology and  automation in every sector  is rapidly increasing. People rely more on 
mobile devices for almost every task in their day to day lives. Restaurant Business is a sector which has a very 
large scope in automation and use of technology. At such times waiting for the waiter to take orders, delivering 
food, lengthy queues, etc. can be very displeasing for the customers of the restaurant.  
To overcome these problems a concept of automated restaurants using a system which uses LCD displays, 
mobile/tablet devices and a system for the chef to interact with customers is proposed. Using Machine Learning 
and Data Science predictions are made based on the reviews and other data of the customer can help make the 
dining experience better as well as it will help the restaurant to manage and make the restaurant grow. 
In a  restaurant while  placing order,  the customer  has to ask  the waiter  whether a particular food item is 
available or not and after that he/she has to give the order. As well as several times it happens that customers 
have to wait for the waiter to come to their table which is sometimes frustrating.  
Storing  the statistical  data of  the restaurant  is a  very  tedious task.  There  is  need of  managing the  data of inventory, customer orders and reviews, staff ,payroll


Conclusion: 
Thus, in this project an efficient and  user-friendly method is proposed which will provide automated 
systems in  the restaurant  and solve problems faced  by the  restaurants using technologies like  Android, Web 
Development and Machine Learning. Interactive User Interfaces for the customers and restaurant staff will be 
provided  and customers  can order  food  directly through the  module without interacting  with waiter. Using 
Machine Learning Models prediction of the food preferred by the customers and also information necessary for 
the restaurant to grow in business through customer reviews and other data. The system saves a lot of time of the 
customer as well as the restaurant staff and helps the restaurant in many ways.
